## NATIVE NODE MODULES: 

set of tools that come inbuilt in node

documentation link - https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v18.x/api/fs.html#callback-example

>FILE SYSTEM : Its a native node module that allows us to access the local storage
> const fs = require("fs"); this is how to initialise the native module....inside the double quotes, write module name.
> writeFile() -->
 const fs = require("fs");
fs.writeFile("message.txt","Hello from NodeJS", (err) => {
    if (err) throw err;
    console.log('The file has been saved!')
}); 

creates a file called message.txt in which it is written Hello from NodeJS 
if there is error it will throw an error 
if there is no error, it write in the console - the file has been saved

>readFile() -->
import { readFile } from 'node:fs';

readFile('filePath','utf8', (err, data) => {
  if (err) throw err;
  console.log(data);
});
 
//reads file mentioned in the path , reads the data and writes in the console 
output is in the buffer format is not specified 
since we specified here , the output is in the text format (utf8);//



//NPM package manager - node package manager
open source package manager

npm.js -> npm packages

2. npm install <>

//ECMAscrpit modules - it uses import statement instead of using variables. We need to specify the "type" : "module", in the key value pair in the json file
