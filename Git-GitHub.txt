local implementations- GIT

git init - initialises repo
git add - adds the file into the staging area
git commit -m : submit changes, with a message in present tense
git log : save point messages are seen along with a hash which uniquely identifies the changes along with author and date
git status 
git diff - to know the difference between last save point and recent save point
git checkout <filename> updates the file to its last save point
git rm --cached -r . : to remove all items from the staging area.
git branch <branch name> - creates a new branch
git branch - gives list of branches and the current branch in which you are.
git checkout <branch name> - switches to the given branch

GIT IGNORE:

1.create a file .gitignore - echo .gitignore
2.open the file using code .gitignore
3.save the file
4.add the names of the files to be ignored on individual lines
5.Again save the file

# is used for comments 
*.extention : example : *.txt - ignores all files having txt extention






remote implementation - GIT-HUB

git is used to store ur repositories on your local device
in order to save the repos on the internet remotely we use git hub

on git hub anyone can access the repos and make changes if the repo is public 
we need to push the local repo to remote repo
STEP 0: create a new repo on git hub(public/pvt)
		copy the url of the repo
1.git remote add origin <url of your remote repo>
//it creates a remote repo named origin and assigns the url of your git hub repo which you created. So a remote repo of name origin having GitHub url is created
2.git push -u <remote name> <branch name>
this links your local repo to the remote repo using the u flag
git push -u origin main  //(pushing it to the main branch)

to create a branch: git branch -m master main

working directory -> staging area -> local repo -> remote repo
		 git add	git commit 	git push

untracked files apear in red
files in the git initialised repo not added to the staging area are shown in red
tracked files apear in green
files in the initialised repo added to the staging area are in green

CLONING - GIT CLONE
in order to clone a remote repo into ur local machine, we use git clone
syntax - git clone <url>
git merge <name-of-branch>

FORKING:
Forking is making a copy of a publically available repo and storing it onto your GitHub account
